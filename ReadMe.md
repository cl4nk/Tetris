## Tetris

Made by Nicolas Fontes.

Created in 2014, at the second year of my Bachelor, at the Faculty of Sciences, Marseille, FRANCE. It is my first video game project.

Made in C, with GTK2, the audio module of CSFML (a C version of SFML), and Pango.

Features:

  -  Basic features of Tetris (blocks, lines, and score)
  -  Sounds
  -  Skin selection
  -  Saves
  -  Mode selection (classic, bad blocks, from below, strange blocks)
  -  Bonuses
  -  Best scores
